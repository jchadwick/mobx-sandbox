He brings this same method to speaking, using analogies, abstractions and stories to simplify intermediate and advanced concepts for beginning audiences. Greg has spoken at numerous conferences and user groups across the country and generally takes a contrarian view of the silver bullets that plague the field.\r\n\r\nWhen Greg is not on the road, he is working from his home office, or spending time with his wife, four daughters and his derpy dog.
