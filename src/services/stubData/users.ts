Greg is also the defacto onshore Microsoft development expert in the team.\r\n\r\nFor the past six years, Greg has focused on the common problems plaguing IT departments, with the intent of finding solutions. Greg's primary method is to examine problems from a variety of perspective, find the common patterns and then build frameworks that can work in a wide variety of organizations. He brings this same method to speaking, using analogies, abstractions and stories to simplify intermediate and advanced concepts for beginning audiences. Greg has spoken at numerous conferences and user groups across the country and generally takes a contrarian view of the silver bullets that plague the field.\r\n\r\nWhen Greg is not on the road, he is working from his home office, or spending time with his wife, four daughters and his derpy dog. When not working, he can often be found seeking out another new craft beer, playing pub trivia or seeking out a geek boardgame night."
