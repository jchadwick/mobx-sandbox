With traditional web technologies, creating applications that appear “fast” to the users can be difficult. To solve this problem developers have been finding new and creative ways to leverage the browsers client-side functionality. One of the most popular frameworks for creating a web application with powerful client-side front end functionality is Angular. Angular is a powerful client side data framework that lets you bind and manipulate data easily in a way that seems lightning fast to your users. And the best part is you don’t need to be a JavaScript ninja to use it! This session will show you how to leverage Angular with your ASP.NET MVC application to create applications that your users will love and you’ll love to build.",

It’s hard to debug. Heck, it’s not even compiled! Besides, I have all these nifty ASP.NET controls that take care of all that for me, right? Thanks to client side libraries like jQuery, Angular and others, JavaScript is experiencing a renaissance. It’s evolved from that weird browser language you used to use because you had to, to a powerful tool for creating web applications with richly featured client-side user interface. But it doesn’t stop there; JavaScript is everywhere from server side code to hybrid mobile application.  If you’re a .NET developer who’s avoided JavaScript it’s time to jump back into the pool! This session will explain some of the key difference between JavaScript and C#/VB.NET, explain what the major JavaScript frameworks are what they do, and show you how to leverage some simple JavaScript in your ASP.NET application.",

        "description": "A key concept of any Agile methodology is communication. It’s no longer normal or acceptable for developers to sit and develop applications in isolation from the business. To that end, developers and business domain experts have been trying to find better ways to communicate. While developers tend to speak in terms of “code and technology” most business domain experts are more comfortable communicating in terms of scenarios, workflows and business rules.\r\n Test Driven Development (TDD) was the first step in getting these two groups to communicate in the same way. Developers could write unit tests that expressed business requirements with the hope that business users could validate that what was being tested was in fact what the desired behavior was. But, unit tests are still code and while it was better, the communication was still stilted and inefficient.\r\n\r\nTo help this communication new techniques such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) have become popular. Along with these new ideas, new tools like SpecFlow have become popular as a means to express unit tests in a way that the business can better understand and validate.\r\n\r\nThis session will demonstrate how SpecFlow can be leveraged in your BDD or ATDD practices. The Gherkin language and the “Given, When, Then” paradigm will be explained and you will see how to write tests in a way that business users are not only capable of reading, but can also help you create them.",

What about all those exotic frameworks? And what the heck is a \"container?!\" The bad news; this knowledge is a MUST HAVE for most testable applications these days. The good news, they are simpler than you think and besides simply making your code testable will also lead to good architecture practices that will help you develop better applications.

The ramification of this is an organization’s failure to consider financial implications stemming from system under performance and outages.  Ultimately, they perceive each issue and its resolution as a necessary expense and view finding the issue without incurring additional costs as positive. \r\n\r\nWith this, developers must find a way to reduce the effort to track and analyze potential issues without incurring additional expense, and by using various systems from open source projects along with relying on small changes to programming, it becomes easy to locate, analyze, and report problems in a clear and meaningful way which reduce downtime, stress, and overall cost.",

Most controllers now feature one or more joysticks, a direction pad, and a number of buttons. As successful as this model is, it greatly limits interactivity between player and game. Developers are forced to utilize this input or require extra equipment, which deters them from creating their own controllers because of added cost and production and inherently limits the possibility of a richer player experience. It’s time to re-evaluate the benefits of adding a custom controller to your own game. \r\n\tCustom controllers open the opportunity for a more immersive game experience. Using a custom built example, this talk will examine games that deviate from using standard input. In addition to discussing where to source materials, we will explore how players’ game interactions can change how we perceive the game as a whole. The audience will walk away with a deeper understanding of the importance of interactivity in game design. \r\n\tThis is a talk for all audiences. I hope that this talk will allow for a new kind of critical thinking about games for audiences who may be familiar with games but not be familiar with game design. For those in the audience who are more technical, I hope this is a call to action to make game controllers more accessible for those who might be physically disabled. \r\n\r\n",

        "description": "There are seven fights that I have over and over again, whenever I start at a company. I'm here to convince you that it's valuable for everyone to have these things in mind from the inception of a project.\r\nHaving these fights early prevents you from doing the software equivalent of poking chocolate chips into an already-baked cookie\r\nDetails\r\nUsually we think of compound interest as what adds magically to our retirement or makes our student loans last forever. But there is also a compound interest of technical debt, where a project is made harder and more expensive because of early \"cost-saving\" choices.\r\nI think it's empowering for developers and other people involved in the inception of a project to have tools for making the project better long-term.\r\nThe seven things I think should be considered very early in development are:\r\n1. Localization. Are you ever planning on selling this to someone in another country?\r\n2. Security. Don't be the organization that has to pay someone for disaster PR. Building in security early saves you a bunch of time and user churn later.\r\n3. Extensibility. What makes you so sure this API will always be internal?\r\n4. Documentation. People do not buy software solely based on Powerpoints. You need public docs. The docs have to be more useful than Stack Overflow.\r\n5. Affordance. UI is not a word. The microtext matters.\r\n6. Acceptance. Have you shown this to any actual humans who are like the users?\r\n 7. Accessibility. We all use computers different ways. Does your software allow that?\r\n\r\nI expect this talk will be relevant to both senior people working on leading project teams, and empowering for juniors who don't have a structure for critiquing usability problems.

        "description": "There are certain inevitable things in life: death and taxes. \r\n\r\nThere is also the loss of knowledge. Data gets senile. It forgets its links, it only wants to tell you about the old days. Wikis overgrow like the thorns around Sleeping Beauty's castle, and reference manuals accrete into sedimentary layers. APIs gather and leak data like municipal water systems. Even with search, we can't find what we're looking for. Too much documentation is as bad or worse than no documentation. \r\n\r\nThis talk is not about data in the abstract, it's about ergot poisoning and hoarding and konmari and bitrot. When and why to kill your precious data, why data is a double-edged sword.\r\n\r\nWe are building giant predictive structures on big data, but we are not evaluating the age or value of that data. Have you ever been boggled by your credit report? We are building thousands of reports like that with no consideration for the quality of the data we are using.\r\n\r\nIt is our responsibility, our moral obligation, to also attend to the death and burial of data. I'll give you some advice on when to kill off data, and how to go about it so you don't end up regretting your choices. I'll also discuss the reasons we need to be building lifespans into all our data.",

        "description": "Continuous Deployment is a powerful vehicle to carry code to production. It promises quick, frequent, and well-tested releases with zero-downtime deployment, decoupled services, and an end to fallible manual testing.\r\n\r\nBut every solution is a compromise, and the complexity of CD can dissuade risk-averse teams. In this talk, we describe lessons learned in continuously deploying Node.js applications in Docker at major UK media and energy corporations, and how those lessons can be applied to teams of any size.\r\n\r\nThis talk uses a distributed Node.js example application to demonstrate: \r\n- CI/testing best practices\r\n- debugging and system acceptance testing locally before CI\r\n- provisioning and deploying cloud-agnostic infrastructure\r\n- continuously testing and deploying an application\r\n- how to fix CD when it breaks. \r\n\r\nThe demo application also features \"live feedback\" that can be used by the audience to participate in the talk.\r\n\r\nSession learning aims\r\n- Hands-on examples of Continuous Deployment, as informed by enterprise teams\r\n- CD best practices and gotchas, and what to do when it goes wrong\r\n- A developers' introduction to DevOps, and tooling recommendations\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim is to ensure teams can release software early, frequently, and successfully. Failure to release costs time and money, and with the adoption of best-practices teams can optimise project delivery, reducing cost and risk for stakeholders.\r\n",

        "title": "React Native To The Rescue",
        "description": "Users want their apps to be intuitive and enjoyable - seamlessly designed for the device in their hand. Developers want powerful tools that enable, encourage, and empower them to craft their vision into reality. Businesses want to reduce time to market, cost, and risk. In the world of mobile development, sadly these needs have been locked in conflict, inevitably leading to someone (or often everyone) losing. Although many tools have tried to answer the call, none have solved the problem without compromise. Either users grudgingly give up their native experience, developers are hindered by unfamiliar and subpar tools, or businesses are forced to spend more time and money while also increasing their risk. In the worst of cases, all three can happen, and as a community we need to do better.\r\n\r\nReact Native promises to answer these needs without the compromise. In this talk, we will explore how React Native empowers developers to create truly native apps that are delightful to use, while answering the real needs of business. Using the canvas of a cross platform app, we will walk through how React Native's approach enables quick and enjoyable development, reduces cost and complexity, and produces an experience with the same finesse as native development. Come see if React Native can rescue you from compromise.",

Yet, despite the infinite possibilities that spring from their imaginations, many developers are thwarted by the first step: how does one get started? A cursory glance seems to point to a default answer of C. C# is picking up steam as Microsoft throws money behind it, while there is a rapidly expanding community around Node. On the outskirts, there is an upstart challenger named Go backed by the behemoth that is Google. How to choose?\r\n\r\nAs in the days of yore, this talk suggests a tournament of champions to determine a winner - pitting these languages in a battle royal. By crafting a program to control a friendly battle bot in each language, we will examine the tale of the tape - discussing the ecosystem, tools, strengths and weaknesses each combatant brings to the ring. So join the fray, cheer on a favorite, and see who walks out on top.",

Sadly, despite wielding this distinctive talent, many developers allow the value of the work they create to be judged by century old methods designed to measure the efficiency of manufacturing gun powder. This talk is a call to arms presented by a recovering workaholic, who throughout his recovery has been searching for a better way. It will explore the concept of value, trace the history of using time as a metric, discuss the effect time tracking has on humans, and propose a couple of potentially better ways.

We use both the OpenID Connect and the Graph API provided by Azure AD to manage our users identity along with on premise syncing.  We leverage the scalability of Azure SQL and App services to run our web platform that is built with Orchard.  Azure storage provides our media storage along with how we are distributing our desktop apps packaged with Squirrel.  We leverage the basic app services hosting to host our help documentation that is built using a python static site generator.  The static site is deployed using Kudu and secured using Azure AD all from the Azure Portal.  We have learned a lot along this journey and would love to share our experiences.",

        "description": "Build tools don't always get the attention they deserve.  Tools like TeamCity and Jenkins allow users to easily create builds with a user interface.  However, your build logic is tied to your CI server.  Tools like Cake allow  you to decouple your builds from your build server and also provide the advantage that you can run the build locally, which is great. Let us consider the build server debugging dance of commit, wait, fail, commit, wait, fail, commit, wait, success.  With a build that runs locally that cycle is shortened because you can run it locally and you have a working build on every commit. In addition to these benefits, Cake uses C# and the .NET framework , putting thousands of libraries easily in reach for creating plugins to elevate your builds to another layer.  We will explore build tools, focusing on Cake.   You will be introduced to the Cake DSL, the basic build file, and the addin structure for Cake, and we may even build an addin.",

As part of the presentation we will work together to generate and post a contribution live.\r\n\r\nContributions come in all forms: bug reports, code, documentation, and promotion. Although some contributions are definitely more challenging than others, I have found that they are invaluable to personal growth and coding development. Together we will explore sample contributions from the community to help build your confidence and to provide an overview of what to expect.  The challenge before the next techbash is to make at least one contribution to a project that you use or that needs attention.  \r\n\r\n-- I would like to do a live contribution, just have to find one that very easy and is up for grabs.",

        "description": "What Is The Wing Chun (Eternal Spring) Method ? \r\n\r\nWhat is Wing Chun; in short it is a method of knowledge acquisition and development. This is a method that can be applied to any pursuit. There are 5 key phases to this method and they are identified as follows;\r\n\r\n1.       Define your purpose\r\n\r\n2.       Identify Attributes\r\n\r\n3.       Identify Principles\r\n\r\n4.       Develop Attributes and internalize principles\r\n\r\n5.       Apply and Refine\r\n\r\nThe Eternal Spring Method applied to coding;\r\n\r\nIn phase one we define in the simplest terms possible what our objective is, what is it we want the software to do. In defining the objective we need to make sure that we can establish some form of metric so we have a concrete and realistic perception of how effective we are in applying the method. In phase two we consider what qualities we need to develop, modify, or acquire within the software itself in order to accomplish our stated purpose. In phase three we look at what is intrinsically true about our relationship to our environment(the software environment), these truths are identified as principles. We then ask ourselves how we can utilize these principles in accomplishing our purpose. Phase four is concerned with implementation methodology, what is the most efficient way to express the attributes and utilize principles that will allow the software to dynamically move forward in accomplishing it's goal. In phase five we test ,does the software actually accomplish it's  goal and while in this test mode we are measuring how efficient and effective we are in dynamically accomplishing our goal and if our progress is unsatisfactory we must re-examine and if necessary refine our implementation methodology or take yet another step back and look at whether or not we have correctly identified the necessary attributes and principles.",

The next step is often to turn those User Stories into executable tests that can help you validate the proper behavior of your complex software systems.  Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is the engine that can help to drive this process on your project.  The logical evolution of the often too fine-grained process of Test-Driven Development, BDD not only represents a somewhat different technical practice but, more importantly, it also suggests an entirely different way of thinking about your system and the way in which you test it.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will begin with a series of simple User Stories and demonstrate how the BDD process supports our codifying these User Stories into a series of “executable specifications” that can be used to validate the proper functionality of our complex software system.  We will work at first without any of the complex overhead of so-called ‘BDD Frameworks’ to demonstrate the important concepts of BDD and then move on to investigate how and why one might look to use various ‘BDD Frameworks’ to offload some of the repetitive work often involved in the BDD process.  Attendees should expect to leave with a good understanding of both the conceptual process that is Behavior-Driven Development as well as some of the technical practices that can help support its successful adoption.\r\n\r\nThe ideal attendee will have several years’ experience in developing complex software solutions.

The reality for your app's users, though, is often a slow and unreliable network with spotty coverage. What happens when the network doesn't work, or when the device is in airplane mode? You get unhappy, frustrated users. Building on the principles of mobile first, offline first is an approach to application design in which a web, mobile, desktop, or Internet of Things (IoT) application is built for offline usage first and is then progressively enhanced to take advantage of network connectivity when available.\r\n\r\nAn offline-first app is an app that works, without error, when there is no network connection. An offline-first app can provide a better, faster user experience — both offline and online — by storing content and data locally and then applying progressive enhancement to synchronize with the cloud when a reliable network connection is available. An offline-first approach can be taken with Progressive Web Apps, mobile apps (native and hybrid), desktop apps (e.g. Electron), and Internet of Things (IoT) apps.",

        "description": "There are many different ways to log messages in .NET and many different libraries to do it with. Now I'll show you the best way. Logs aren't helpful if their data is stuck in a database or a text file. The data from application logs should be turned into useful information and exposed to as many people as possible. The best way to measure performance of an application or find out if there are issues, is to visualize the logs and data graphically. In this talk I'll do a brief introduction of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and teach you how they work together. I'll show you how to integrate them into your .NET-based applications and ultimately, how to use them to graphically show log data over time with Kibana. You will learn how to measure performance, show application status, and even report errors quickly and effectively. After this talk you will be able to build effective and informative dashboards in Kibana for your entire team to take advantage of.",

        "description": "Still Living in a Waterfall World? You're Not Alone! Convincing your company to use an Agile development approach for application development can be surprisingly difficult.  While the initial benefits excite everyone, that enthusiasm often disappears when the true trade-offs of Agile become apparent.  You may even find that many members of the development team aren't willing to give up their waterfall patterns of development.  How do you convince the business that good software doesn't begin and end with a giant Microsoft Project Plan? In this session we'll discuss how you can get your company moving down the path to more effective software development and bridge the gap between traditional practices and the current software development landscape\r\n\r\n•How to discuss Agile with the Business: It's their money, you need to make sure they're on board with how you're going to spend it.\r\n•Convincing the Team to Work Differently: Without the right patterns of development within your team, your first Agile project may be the last for a while.\r\n•Useful Compromises: When you can't change the world overnight, how do you at least get the ship turning in the right direction?\r\n\r\nPresented by one of the founders of Gibraltar Software, we'll discuss how we've worked with many enterprise customers to marry agile practices into traditional teams.  Sometimes successful  sometimes a brilliant failure - come and learn from our mistakes so you can produce better results and have happier customers and team members. We won't be focusing on a specific technology or Agile approach but rather how you get businesses to accept giving up the Gantt chart and learn to love software development.\r\n",

In this technical presentation, you’ll learn the reasons behind the isomorphic architecture of shared data and see some code examples written in CoffeeScript.",

These sorts of projects are integrative at all stages of the system development life cycle and concern issues of available technology services, infrastructure, components, as well as people. Many students do not realize the process of large scale software development until much after their graduation. On the other hand, hackathon-goers have it a step ahead, as they have been a part of the \"industry\" by developing and presenting creative applications. In this presentation, I will talk about the student's perspective on large scale projects and how hackathons are transforming college student's ideology for the better.\r\n\r\nSecond Session: Learn how to make lucrative applications using one common source code, using Ionic Framework along with Adobe PhoneGap.

It’s relatively easy to build your own and have it hosted in the cloud, for free. Understanding the Alexa Skills Kit will allow you to build private tools for personal use (like asking Alexa to find your phone) or public applications (such as a conference helper to get information about speakers and sessions).\r\n\r\nThis session will cover an introduction to the Echo, the Alexa Skills Kit, and a NodeJS/AWS Lambda/DynamoDB development environment for building skills. Then, we will use the development environment to build the conference helper skill. The environment, including a testing harness (for local and remote testing) and build/deployment scripts, will be available for download for your use in building new skills.\r\n\r\nIt is an exciting time to get involved in building skills as the frameworks are relatively young and development is happening rapidly. It is an opportunity to get involved and make significant contributions to a platform that will continue to grow in popularity.",

        "description": "Are you tired of manual installs and updates? Have you run into problems caused by incompatible libraries? Do you need to notify your colleagues for every single new release of your library? If the answer is YES, then consider about package managers. A package manager is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner. A package manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files. Packages contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. This session will give you a brief overview of some common used package managers.",

While a healthy, advantaged person may not have to worry about running out of ‘spoons,’ people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, as well as members of marginalized communities, often have to consider how they need to ration their energy in order to get through the day. Understanding how spoon theory can affect the lives of your developers and teammates could help companies lessen the everyday burdens on their underrepresented employees, leaving them more spoons to do their best work, avoid burnout and live a more fulfilling personal life at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe focus on human collaboration in agile development, in particular, is well served by understanding the differing needs of the individual members of your team. Spoons are an intangible unit of measurement, not unlike how velocity might be tracked across an agile team. If you believe that your team is the driving force behind your success, having an appreciable metric of the limit of their energy and capability is essential, in order to care for people and not push them beyond their limits.

At 105,000 stars, and over 48,000 forks on GitHub, it comes in as the second most popular repository of all time. Bootstrap is an amazing tool, but it's not without it's problems. Have you ever found yourself overriding a default Bootstrap style? Including CSS or JS for components you don't use? Or maybe you're just tired of your website looking like everyone else's? We put up with this technical debt because of the wins Bootstrap provides, but what if we could keep the benefits without all of the headache? Enter Atomic Design.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion, we will start by exploring the problems Atomic design solves, how it promotes consistency/cohesion, easily traverses from abstract to concrete, and provides methodology for crafting an effective design system. Next we will get our hands dirty by digging into a concrete implementation of an Atomic Design based toolkit. Finally, we will go over resources for further education, how to begin the process of integrating Atomic Design into your process, and next steps. By the end of this talk you will be comfortable with Atomic Design basics and have the knowledge and resources necessary to create your own atomically driven comprehensive component library.",

This is very difficult, as development tends to think in terms of backlog, but operations tends to think in terms of tickets. From experience, this purist form of DevOps rarely works. But there is one concept that seems to be universally accepted as a DevOps practice that can radically alter the effectiveness of your organizational software delivery: automating the delivery pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis session focuses on the idea of continuous everything, taken from years of experience consulting clients in building pipelines to support microservices architecture. The concepts and practices presented in this session are easily migrated to other architectural forms. In general, the session covers practices starting with \"continuous\", including Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Inspection.  While this content of the session is tool agnostic, you will be presented with a sample set of tools that you can use to automate different portions of your software delivery pipeline, including Jenskins, Chef and Puppet, Bamboo, and Docker.\r\n\r\nTopics you will learn include\r\n* How to build a toolkit for automating your delivery pipeline\r\n* Sample roadmaps to get from zero to complete automation\r\n* The importance of different types of monitoring\r\n* Migrating to a DevOps culture",

        "description": "Life would be so much easier if everything was in a database or pulled via API. But that is not the case. All too often we get data files (or have to send them) in various formats. This session discusses some of the tools available to help you figure out what the file looks like so you can pull it apart using those tools or your tool-of-preference. While the GNU version of these tools will be the focus, the skills learned apply to many different platforms (Microsoft’s Bash under Windows 10, Cygwin under Microsoft Windows, MAC OSX, the Linux core of Android, commercial Linux — like Red Hat Enterprise, and commercial UNIX — like IBM’s AIX or Sun/Oracle’s Solaris).\r\n\r\nOf particular interest are ‘head’, ‘tail’, ‘wc’, ‘awk’, ‘dd conv’, and shells.\r\n\r\nA few of the differences between UNIX/Linux and Windows will also be discussed in case you ever have to deal with those environments in our heterogeneous environments. This knowledge also comes in handy if you need to migrate code from an existing UNIX/Linux-based application.\r\n",

        "description": "The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) defined the look and feel of video games in the late 80’s and early 90’s. It was designed around the MOS Technologies 6502 CPU, a cheap microprocessor developed in 1975 and still manufactured today. The NES’ impressive library of games was written using 6502 assembly language. Compared to assembly languages for modern processors, 6502 assembly is relatively simple, with only 53 possible instructions, one accumulator, two index registers, and a 256-byte stack. Combined with the NES’ custom “Picture Processing Unit” (PPU) and highly optimized memory layout, these simple foundations allow for an incredibly diverse range of game experiences, and developers continually pushed the bounds of what the system was thought capable of until its commercial demise in 1995.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the design of the NES’ hardware and memory layout, focusing on the system’s graphical capabilities and limitations. We’ll take a brief look at writing assembly code for the 6502 and put this into practice with techniques common to many types of games: metatile (“map”) compression, collision detection, and random number generation. Finally, we’ll discuss what a modern toolkit for NES assembly development looks like, and how you can get started developing your own NES games.",

At the same time, JavaScript has emerged as the lingua franca of web programming and can be found in many places beyond just the browser. \r\n\r\nWhat if I told you there was a mature protocol that's been around since 1983 and was uniquely poised to take advantage of this development?\r\n\r\nWell, wonder no more and [meet MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI)! \r\n\r\nSitting at convergence of these two things is MIDI — a niche protocol that's been around since 1983 and was originally designed for musical instruments to communicate with one another. It's event-oriented approach to messaging feels right at home in the asynchronous world of JavaScript & Node, and the prevalence of MIDI support in older musical equipment means you can find unique, hackable and affordable hardware at your local pawnshop or Craig's List.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely tech stack — Tiny Computers + JavaScript + MIDI — can lend itself to creative programming beyond music.

Traditionally, the choice has been to select which relational database to choose. But with all the NoSql databases available, there are many more choices that may be a better fit for your application. What are the trade offs among all the choices? Why pick just one? I will give some practical examples of how to combine different types of databases. Microsoft released Document DB a couple of years ago, which was their first managed NoSql cloud database. Just recently Cosmos DB has expanded those offerings and made it easier than ever to use. Cosmos DB is a service that contains several types of databases: Relational, Key Value Pair, Document and Graph. I will explain what each of these are, along with some code samples for each one to get you started.

Every producer and consumer of data that participates in this ecosystem increases its overall value.\r\n\r\nOData is consistent with the way the Web works – it makes a deep commitment to URIs for resource identification and commits to an HTTP-based, uniform interface for interacting with those resources (just like the Web). This commitment to core Web principles allows OData to enable a new level of data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop Chris Woodruff will provide an in depth knowledge to this protocol and how to implement an OData service on Windows using ASP.NET Core Web API.",

These two concepts are the key to architecting in the future. Come with me as I dig a little deeper into these concepts within k8s and Docker and provide some examples from my own work.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore these concepts within k8s and Docker as well as work I’ve done in my current role around continuous delivery pipelines. Attendees will leave with an appreciation for these two concepts and the tools necessary to begin architecting their systems similarly.\r\n\r\nAbstractions and metadata are the future of architecture in systems engineering as they were before in software engineering. In many languages, there are abstractions and metadata. However, systems engineering has never adopted this view. Systems were always thought of as too unique for any standard abstractions. Now we’ve standardized the lower-level abstractions and we’re ready to build new system-level abstractions.\r\n\r\nDocker has become the standard unit of processing, which has alleviated many of the diversity issues within systems. Docker did this with abstractions around networking, cpu, memory, and filesystems.\r\n\r\nKubernetes is now using Docker to create higher-level abstractions, but they've even abstracted away the runtime. Kubernetes uses concepts like PersistentVolumes, Routes, Services, and Deployments as abstractions. \r\n\r\nMy team has created an abstraction around continuous delivery pipelines that provides us more flexibility with underlying resources. It's a simple system based on certain abstractions and specific metadata. We've abstracted the build and deploy systems from the deployment pipeline model as well as accumulated metadata attributed to people, data, and pipelines to ensure security and compliance at scale.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with:\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with an appreciation for abstractions and metadata in their systems and the tools necessary to begin architecting their systems similarly.

Mastering the stack presents a challenge to even the seasoned developer. Fortunately, there is a cheat that can shorten the curve. Throughout computer history, there has been a symbiosis between game and app development. This is not by chance, but is rooted in the natural inclination of humans to learn through play. This talk will take advantage of the deep link between play and learning to teach new techniques that enable high level user experiences through the medium of building a game.\r\n\r\nThe session will begin with a discussion of how to develop for performance. Next, it will examine the power of real-time communication with socket.io, how to incorporate it, and the magic this creates. The talk will then turn to the canvas element, exploring the possibilities it brings to the party. Finally, animations will be considered, adding polish to delight the user.\r\n\r\nCome play with react and node, and leave with some serious new tricks.",

Or is there something just a little bit further that can give us even more FRP, Functional Reactive Programming, is an powerful technique that will let you write easy to grok programs that will grow well.\r\n\r\nFlux, the unidirectional data flow paradigm best captured by Redux, has changed the way many developers view developing complicated UI projects. It has been so popular that it has seen variations developed in a number of other languages beyond its Javascript roots. It is simple basic pattern that is easy for people to understand. And the power grows exponentially in a system like Redux with its powerful middleware system.\r\n\r\nFrequently, developers working within this framework are reaching for just a little more power. Redux, or resident stand in for Flux, has no built in support for async actions, and lacks other techniques for managing side effects well.\r\n\r\nWith Functional Reactive Programming, FRP, you learn that Flux/Redux is really a simplified, and very restricted, implementation of an FRP system. Learn how to use RxJS to implement Flux, and see what it gives you out of the box that Flux/Redux do not.",

To start, we'll explore the business case of why you should be writing tests by comparing three different companies that had different ideas when it came to testing and what the outcomes were. From there, we’ll look at the fundamentals of testing by talking about the pros/cons of unit, integration, and UI testing. Finally, we’ll look at some resources to learn how to write tests. Intended for developers who are new to testing, by the end of this presentation, you will understand why you should write tests, and will have the concepts and tools to get started.",

As a bonus we’ll also cover a few of the differences between umbrella apps and microservices as well as how the Elixir community is moving towards a more thoughtful architecture for apps.\r\n\r\nUmbrella apps are a type of Elixir (and Erlang) application that allow you to have nested OTP applications as part of the same bigger ecosystem. You can think of them as a sort of microservice architecture in which the bulk of the infrastructure work is handled for you by the VM. It makes super nice and easy to handle inter dependencies, integration testing, different scaling needs, distribution, etc… A part of extracting multiple apps is thinking where to define the boundaries, that’s where DDD, bounded contexts and aggregates come into play, and even though they are not something that came out of the Elixir or Erlang communities is something that is being discussed a lot as a way to build more maintainable, scalable and adaptable application.\r\n\r\nHaving come from the Rails world, this separation of concerns and clear cut boundaries was something somewhat foreign to me, but it has been extremely fun to learn and think about this things. Also, I believe I have taken some of this into my Rails’ apps, making them more modular and less coupled, even if still drinking the whole majestic monolith kool aid.",

        "description": "DevOps. So hot right now. So hot your managers have jumped on the buzzword bandwagon and have told you to \"make it happen\", but also not to subvert the company change process. You can do that, right?\r\n\r\nAs tech professionals, we know you can't just exchange cash for DevOps, but how can you convince the higher-ups?  Particularly when upper management won't let go of the perceived safety of a slow-moving product delivery cycle.\r\n\r\nThis talk looks at the realities of implementing DevOps in an organisation that is resistant to change. We'll discuss the levels of technical and cultural change that you absolutely need, the barriers that commonly get in the way, and some techniques to get around them. Expect subtle and possibly even underhanded tips to get things moving in an environment that just wants to use the word \"DevOps\" without making the necessary changes.",

Ubiquitous language, proper boundaries, encapsulation, it all made sense. \r\n\r\nBut along the way, something went completely and utterly wrong. It started with arguments on the proper way of implementing aggregates and entities. Arguments began over project and folder structure. Someone read a blog post that repositories are evil, and ORMs the devil incarnate. Another read that relational databases are last century, we need to store everything as a stream of events. Then came the actor model and frameworks that sounded like someone clearing their throat. Instead of a nice, clean architecture, the team chased the next new approach without ever actually shipping anything. \r\n\r\nBeyond the endless technical arguments it causes, domain-driven design can actually produce great software. We have to look past the hype into the true value of DDD, what it can bring to our organizations and how it can enable us to build quality systems. With the advent of microservices, DDD is more important than ever - but only if we can get to the good parts.",

We’ve all been told that the confluence of the explosion of the number of chat messaging platforms, the increasing amount of attention users give to messaging experiences (at the expense of other experiences), huge improvements in NLP (Natural Language Processing), and the increased efficacy of Artificial Intelligence are all combining to make chatbots “the next frontier in user engagement”.  And yet, if all that is true, why is Facebook pulling back on its promotion of Facebook Messenger Chatbots as their own data shows up to 70% of current Facebook chatbots are considered a “failure” by Facebook users?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll try to separate the hype from reality about the current (and future) state of chatbots.  We’ll explore several of the popular chatbot frameworks that can help you more quickly build chatbots as well as discuss some of the pitfalls and pratfalls that most chatbots tend to stumble over in their implementations (and how to avoid them).  Through this process, we’ll identify a series of important design considerations that can form the foundation of any successful chatbot project and explore the patterns and techniques that can help you develop a truly useful conversational experience for users of your chatbot.",

Reactive programming models can help to solve these challenges. Additionally RxJs considers the impact of time on these observables which facilitate simplifying gesture based recognition. With RxJs bundled into Angular, you'll see how you can use it to simplify traditional event-based programming models.",

However, an IoT system may have to manage a huge number of devices, each one of them has a unique identity and a unique role. This is where the Pets vs Cattle metaphor fails – we need to handle pets in a cloud scale.  Beside the need to manage many end-devices, the IoT system must handle vast amount of data streams, extract near-real-time information as well as conduct batch processing that enables modern business scenarios, utilizing big data and machine learning capabilities.\r\nThis lecture explains the complexity of the IoT problem domain and shows Azure SaaS and PaaS solution approaches: The Azure IoT Central and Azure IoT Suite. We will explore the new Azure Device Provisioning Service (DPS) and see how it provides a scale approach to secure provisioning new IoT devices. We will explore the Azure IoT Hub and see its functional features and non-functional quality attributes such as security, scale, high-availability and health monitoring.\r\nWe will conclude the lecture with the future of IoT: \"Smart Cloud and Intelligent edge\" by presenting the Azure IoT Edge.\r\nYou will learn:\r\n1.\tThe complexity of a modern IoT system\r\n2.\tThe Azure IoT SaaS and PaaS approach\r\n3.\tSecure provisioning IoT devices at scale\r\n4.\tThe smart Azure IoT Edge\r\n",

        "description": "There are cases where bugs are discovered only after the product is shipped and used by the end users. The main reason for these bugs that appear only in the production environment is the use of real user scenarios with real user data. Production debugging is about solving customer-facing issues that aren't easily reproducible in the development or testing environments. When it comes to cloud hosted application, production debugging becomes even harder. The code is running on multiple hosts, a business flow can span many services. A remote debugging session with the cloud is dangerous and may introduce side effects to the current running software, such as performance degradation, interruption of service, and data correctness issues. \r\nMicrosoft provides a new feature that let you take a dump file of a service hosted in Azure. In an analogy, a dump file is like a single picture from a movie – a memory image of a single service in a single execution context. Viewing a dump file might reveal some facts about the execution state of the specific service, but it does not show the business flow and does not provide a way to single-step through the code.\r\nIn this lecture, the audience will see a revolutionary tool and approach for a cloud production debugging. The participant will learn how to get series of related dump files, how to get the right version of the source code for the deployed solution, how to dig into the code and have a what-if scenarios where the developer can change the code and data and see the result without effecting the production environment. \r\nYou will learn:\r\n1.\tThe difficulties of debugging modern cloud hosted application\r\n2.\tMethods and tools for capturing state and debugging cloud hosted services\r\n3.\tAzure, Visual Studio and OzCode Enterprise Cloud Debugger\r\n",

The heater works even if the water in the tank is hot enough, for example in a summer sunny day.

Breaking the system to many small autonomous and high cohesive services, reducing the coupling in the system, having better isolation utilizing modern hosts such as Docker containers and so forth. However, having many small moving parts may lead to higher integration and management complexity. \r\nIn traditional Service-Oriented Architecture, there is usually a controller, or a manager that orchestrates the business flow. Having such a service simplifies the system, but might contradict some of the Micro Service Architecture principals. In the other hand having decoupled services that communicate by publishing messages in a reactive manner, provides the promised Micro Service Architecture flexibility, but introduces the cost of higher complexity. \r\nThe lecture starts with a short introduction to the Micro Service Architecture. Then, the audience will learn about the orchestration and the chorography service communication approaches, the pros and cons of each of the method and even a method that enables combining the two.

At the same time, JavaScript has emerged as the lingua franca of web programming and can be found in many places beyond just the browser.\r\n\r\nWhat if I told you there was a mature protocol that’s been around since 1983 and was uniquely poised to take advantage of this development?\r\n\r\nWell, wonder no more and meet MIDI!\r\n\r\nSitting at convergence of these two things is MIDI — a niche protocol that’s been around since 1983 and was originally designed for musical instruments to communicate with one another. It’s event-oriented approach to messaging feels right at home in the asynchronous world of JavaScript & Node, and the prevalence of MIDI support in older musical equipment means you can find unique, hackable and affordable hardware at your local pawnshop or Craig’s List.\r\n\r\nThis unlikely tech stack — Tiny Computers + JavaScript + MIDI — can lend itself to creative programming beyond music.

Computers were underpowered and consuming AI was too complicated, leaving its benefits unapproachable to all but a small group of experts.  But now advances in Machine Learning coupled with the scale of the Azure Cloud bring us Microsoft Cognitive Services, a collection of purpose-built capabilities based on AI and Machine Learning that make it possible for developers of all backgrounds to easily enrich their own projects with these powerful capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll explore the universe of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services and understand how to use them in your own software projects.  We’ll explore services for Facial Recognition, object detection, Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as Topic Extraction and Sentiment Analysis.  We’ll apply these services to various media types from still images to video to text to discover how easy it can be to bring the power of AI and Machine Learning into your own software systems.",

In this talk, we'll explore Azure Service Fabric -- the same platform Microsoft uses to run services like Skype for Business, Intune, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Data Factory, Azure DocumentDB, Azure SQL Database, and Cortana -- now also available to the broader development community to power your own solutions both on-premises and with any cloud provider you prefer (Azure, AWS, or otherwise).\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we'll explore both micro-services architectures and Actor programming models, and discover how they can greatly simplify both the development of massively-parallel systems and our ability to reason about them as developers.  We'll also understand how Azure Service Fabric (and other micro-services-inspired frameworks) might still have a role to play in your solutions even if you're not actively building the next multi-petabyte parallel processing system in your basement.\r\n",

        "description": "It probably comes as no surprise to anyone with any real-world software development experience that Object-Oriented inheritance modeling can’t cleanly solve every class of problem we face as software engineers.  AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) provides us with an alternative perspective on our objects and their behaviors that can be leveraged to powerfully and flexibly solve whole classes of recurring software engineering challenges that OO systems routinely face.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will both illuminate the fundamental principles and patterns of AOP as well as demystify the different available techniques for adding AOP to the design of OO systems in .NET.  We’ll explore techniques like compile-time and load-time IL-Weaving, Static and Dynamic Proxying, and others.  We’ll also examine several tools and frameworks (both Open-Source/free and commercial options) that make it easier for the .NET developer to add AOP techniques to their toolbox for their everyday work.\r\n",

        "description": "You’re Agile.  You write User Stories.  Now what?  The next step is often to turn those User Stories into executable tests that can help you validate the proper behavior of your complex software systems.  Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is the engine that can help to drive this process on your project.  The logical evolution of the often too fine-grained process of Test-Driven Development, BDD not only represents a somewhat different technical practice but, more importantly, it also suggests an entirely different way of thinking about your system and the way in which you test it.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will begin with a series of simple User Stories and demonstrate how the BDD process supports our codifying these User Stories into a series of “executable specifications” that can be used to validate the proper functionality of our complex software system.  We will work at first without any of the complex overhead of so-called ‘BDD Frameworks’ to demonstrate the important concepts of BDD and then move on to investigate how and why one might look to use various ‘BDD Frameworks’ to offload some of the repetitive work often involved in the BDD process.  Attendees should expect to leave with a good understanding of both the conceptual process that is Behavior-Driven Development as well as some of the technical practices that can help support its successful adoption.\r\n",

While the GNU version of these tools will be the focus, the skills learned apply to many different platforms. Being available on so many platforms gives you lots of choices. Your choices include Microsoft’s Bash under Windows 10, Cygwin under many Microsoft Windows versions, MAC OSX, the Linux core of Android, commercial Linux — like Red Hat Enterprise, and commercial UNIX — like IBM’s AIX or Sun/Oracle’s Solaris.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest are ‘head’, ‘tail’, ‘wc’, ‘awk’, ‘dd conv’, and shells.\r\n\r\nA few of the differences between UNIX/Linux and Windows will also be discussed to ease your shifts in our heterogeneous environments.

There is plenty of talent who have the necessary understanding to perform that analysis but may not have experience with the tools your organization is using (like SAS). When the schools fail in this area, one alternative is for the organization to assist individuals learn those skills and grow within the organization. \r\nWhere it may not be acceptable to spend the learning time while at work using work resources, the use of SAS University Edition provides that opportunity. This version is available free of charge for non-commercial use (learning is certainly non-commercial). \r\nWhile oriented for the employer, the approaches can work for students who want to prepare for a job in this area as well as the educational institutions who will be training them.\r\nThe session will cover: \r\n• Acquiring/installing SAS University Edition \r\n• Approaches for instructing/learning including \"Brown Bag Lunches\" and more formal training \r\n• Combining the informal training with formal courses for a more \"Just in Time\" result (and retaining the learning) \r\n• Motivating and rewarding employees for the learning activities \r\n• Advantages, disadvantages, tips and tricks \r\n• Quick First Program\r\n•\tGetting Data\r\n•\tSaving Data\r\n•\tSorting\r\n•\tControl Breaks and Selection\r\n•\tExpressions\r\n•\tImportant Options\r\n•\tImportant and Interesting PROCs\r\n•\tOther Sources of Information\r\n",

Where do the boundaries of what we can do cross the line of what we should do? What responsibility do we have towards the users of the applications that we create?\r\n\r\nQuite often the average user of web and mobile applications do not understand privacy policies, have no idea why the application needs certain information (sometimes it doesn't!), and are afraid to not give permissions because the app might not work. They also often have no idea how dangerous it can be to have all their information out there.\r\n\r\nSome professions have a governing agency to enforce compliance to an ethical standard, but there is no governing agency over software developers. Does this mean we have no responsibility to be ethical in the software that we create or do we need to hold ourselves to some standard? And what would that standard be?\r\n\r\nI have had an interest in ethics/business ethics since my first year in University when I took a business ethics course. With all the headlines about applications invading privacy of the user, I have often wondered what individual developers thought about the privacy of their users as they were developing the application. It occurs to me that it is possible they had not even given it a thought. \r\n\r\nThis is an exploration into how different ethical mores apply to the work that we do as software developers and what responsibilities we have as developers to the users of the software that we create.",

        "description": "As software developers, our goal is to typically write software that meets the needs of our clients, whether they be internal or external clients. Often times, when we miss the mark, it is due to a communication breakdown between the developer team and the client team on what the actual requirements are.\r\n\r\nCommunication breakdowns generally occur between people with different communication styles. So how do we bridge that gap and get the information we need from people who communicate differently than we do?\r\n\r\nThis talk will be an exploration of communication styles and how we can recognize our own communication style as well as easily determine the communication style of others. With this information we can communicate with someone in the style in which they best receive information. When we communicate with others in their learning style, we break down barriers and are more able to accurately get to the pain points that they need a solution for. Once the communication barriers are down, it becomes easier to get the requirements that we are looking for.\r\n",

The stories originate from Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest and likely go back centuries or more. The term sasquatch itself is an Anglicized derivative of the Halkomelem word sásq’ets.\r\n\r\nMany people are convinced that Bigfoot is real. Others suggest that he is a cultural phenomenon. Some just want to believe. There is even a group, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, that tracks Bigfoot sightings. They have data— thousands of reports—available on the Internet. And, where there is data, we can apply the power of machine learning.\r\n\r\nLet’s get to the bottom of this mystery! We’ll use machine learning to forecast the number of Bigfoot sightings for the coming months and years. We’ll measure the impact of key cultural phenomena—primarily the airing of The X-Files—on Bigfoot sightings. And, we’ll see if we can classify some Bigfoot sightings of our own using natural language processing. Not super-familiar with machine learning? Not a problem. We’ll explore the types of problems above (forecasting, impact analysis, and classification) and I’ll show you how to solve each of them using a little bit of code in assorted languages and the Nexosis API.\r\n\r\nSo, come and get your feet wet (big or small) and begin learning about machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe truth is out there.",

        "description": "Long ago, in the late days of the first Internet boom, before jQuery, before Underscore, before Angular, there was a web application built by a large corporation. This application was written as a server-side application using server-side technology like Java or PHP. A tiny seed of JavaScript was added to some of the pages of this application to give it a little sizzle.\r\n\r\nOver the ages, this tiny bit of JavaScript grew like kudzu. Most of it was embedded in the HTML in &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags. Some of it was dynamically generated by the server-side code. Browser specific hacks were added. An AJAX call was added. jQuery was added. Helper functions were added. Lots of helper functions. So many helper functions.\r\n\r\nIn time pyramids of doom built from anonymous callbacks and hundreds, nay, thousands of interdependent global functions ruled the day. And the programmers did despair. They cried to put the code under test that it might be refactored. \"Add unit tests\", they exhorted. But, lo, there were no units to test, only anonymous functions.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like your current application? I know I've worked on a lot of codebases just like this one. I've come up with some techniques to refactor them and put them under test (so the real refactoring can begin). In this session, I will share them with you.",

The over-saturation of \"must-have\" tools to make lives easier can cause decision paralasis when it comes to working on the web. But what if I told you there was a new gang in town, whose sole mission is to make it easier to get your apps to where they need to be. May I present an opinionated approach to developing web applications in the new world.\r\n\r\nCommand-line interfaces are as old as time, so why would any sane person reccommend using a handful of them in the modern application development space? The answer is ease of use. Time and time again developers are forced to learn a new tool, investigate it's intricacies and master it. Than for no apparent reason, the tool doesn't serve it's purpose in a particular case, and it is thrown away, never to be used again. Simplicity and ease of learning is key to a tool being widely adopted and succuessful. Some may say that losing a graphical interface allows a tool to be more straightforward, and it's mission more apparent. During this session, we will use the power of the command line, with some help of Visual Studio Code, to create, develop, build and deploy an application to the cloud. Here is how we are going to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nUsing Git Bash (it is a CLI after all), we will create a repository to store the code for our app, which will allow us to develop in a scalable way. Once our repository is created and configured, we will create a web service in ASP.NET Core using the dotnet cli, a tool created by Microsoft to standup and configure projects .NET developers are accustom to. After creating our service, we will add some endpoints to it using everyone's favorite free editor Visual Studio Code. Once our service is created, it would be great to have something to call this service and provide a rich experience for users. We will use the Angular CLI to build a Single Page Application that calls our new web service and also showcase some valuable features of the tool. Before we know it, we will have a web application that hits an Api, but it still has to be deployed somewhere. To do this, we will use the Azure CLI to create App Services and deploy our apps to them.\r\n\r\nAnd when all is over, our app and API are deployed to the cloud for all to enjoy. The best part of this approach is that it isn't tied to just development on Windows, and we will see this when we jump onto a Linux environment and make a change to our solution. Now we have everything we need to get our app to the right place, without all the pomp and circumstance that can exist.

Other than keeping us from having to scroll horizontally, how are Promises solving things? \r\n\r\nThis session will start with explaining exactly what a Promise is, and how it deals with the shortcomings of callbacks. We'll look at how Promises allow us to do things that aren't really possible with callback code and thus how they really are a game changer. Next, we'll look at how we can use our newfound understanding of Promises to better exploit the power of the new async and await keywords that make asynchronous code look and feel more like synchronous code. We'll see how a deep understanding of what Promises are, and how to work with them are still extremely important when writing code using async and await.",

Why do we have the perception that accessibility is so difficult to design and develop for? And how does compliance actually fail people with disabilities? \r\n\r\nTo answer those questions, let’s reframe the conversation. Instead of focusing on compliance, let’s look at the personal and cultural changes we can make that will influence our work. With that, we'll come to an understanding of where we fail the people who may need us most. When thinking about my history as a developer, I regret much of my attitude and inexperience. \r\n\r\nI’ll share real-life anecdotes of working with engineering teams from the perspective of a developer-turned-accessibility specialist. We’ll look at the ways that we miss opportunities to be more inclusive designers and ways that we put up barriers between us and the people we want to reach–but also how we can clear the path.

It will explore the daily development life when you are going to be completely outside Visual Studio.  This means getting to know the dotnet command line interface a little better.  Then we'll explore how you can deploy your applications on Linux, including containers and deployment to the cloud.\r\n\r\nThis session is perfect for .NET veterans who are brand new to .NET Core and want to see what the brave new world looks and feels like. It’s okay if you’re unfamiliar with Linux, but are interested in having options available to you. And if you're curious what it's like to work in other tools such as Visual Studio Code and Rider, this session is for you.",

        "description": "Here’s a familiar scenario. To deal with non-stop email inflow, many of us create rules that manage our inbox. We’ve got rules that prioritize, categorize, forward, move and delete. But attempt to add even simple logic tests in the rules and you run into a wall. Taking the big tool approach, you can create an Outlook Addin and use the full power of C# to tackle the problem. But not every programming job or workflow needs a high-powered toolset like C# or Visual Studio. For quick one-offs and simple tasks, you can fall back to more basic tools. With the cloud-based Microsoft Flow, you can quickly and easily build custom automations from your desktop, laptop, or mobile device without needing to write a single line of code. And with PowerApps, you can quickly create a mobile friendly UI that taps into company data and your Flows. Behind the scenes is the Common Data service layer; an easy way to merge disparate data sources.  Read the marketing claims, Microsoft states that PowerApps is a tool for end-users. However, for those of us who code, Microsoft Flow provides a quick way to create personalized automated workflows between applications. Don’t be too quick to judge, behind the scenes Flow is built on top of Azure Logic Apps.  Flow has an impressive list of service providers: like SharePoint, Dynamics 365, Teams, Yammer, Dropbox, Outlook, OneDrive and MailChimp. This session shows how to get started with PowerApps and build interesting integrations with little or no code.",
